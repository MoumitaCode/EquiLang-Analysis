# Project Name: EquiLang

## Problem Statement
EquiLang is designed to highlight the challenges faced by English Language Learners (ELLs) in U.S. schools. By comparing the number of ELL students to the number of schools, it helps identify where resources and support are lacking. The goal is to provide a clear picture of how ELL students, particularly from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, are distributed across the nation and where they need more opportunities for a better education.

## Dataset
- Source: https://civilrightsdata.ed.gov/data
- Description: Data on the number of ELL students and schools across the U.S.
- Size: Includes data from all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
- Quality: The data is sourced from reputable institutions like the U.S. Department of Education and shows a high level of accuracy.

## Features
1. Interactive Analysis
   - Feature 1: Real-time exploration of ELL data, allowing users to view the number of ELL students in specific states and compare it to the number of schools available for these students.
   - Feature 2: Filter options to focus on specific demographics, such as the percentage of students from different racial or ethnic backgrounds, and analyze how these factors affect educational access.
   
2. Data Processing
   - Feature 1: The program organizes data to focus on important details like the number of ELL students and schools in each state.
   - Feature 2: It converts raw data into visual formats for easy comparison, using bar graphs and pie charts to show key trends and insights.

3. Visualizations
   - Type 1: Bar Graphs - comparing the number of ELL students with the number of schools available in top U.S. states. This allows for easy identification of states with the highest disparities in educational resources for ELL students.
   - Type 2: Pie Charts -  showing the racial/ethnic distribution of ELL students, offering a clear representation of how different communities are impacted by language barriers in education.
